MODEL 1

clf = MLPClassifier(solver='lbfgs', alpha=1e-5,
                    hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 2), random_state=1)





TRAIN 1: "no" includes non-circles, curved roads, turntables, and some empty circles and other circles with non-FMGP writing
Accuracy score: 61%


TRAIN 2: "no" includes only non-circles, curved roads, and turntables
Accuracy score: 69.7%
Thus far: seems to be mostly false positives. Turntables?


TRAIN 3: "no" includes turntables and labels. "Yes" includes MGPs.
Accuracy: 72.5%
False pos: 3
False neg: 11

Thought: use Detect Circles to only detect circles (not buildings, etc). Use ML model to distinguish between industrial circles and train turntables/labels.
